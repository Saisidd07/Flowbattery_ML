Flow Battery Efficiency Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting the Coulombic efficiency (CE), voltage efficiency (VE), and energy efficiency (EE) of a flow battery system. The dataset includes historical values of CE, VE, and EE, which were used to train machine learning models.

Models used: Linear Regression and Neural Networks
Libraries: TensorFlow (for the neural network model)
Goal: Predict flow battery efficiency metrics based on historical data and improve overall prediction accuracy.
